# PF2e Downtime Tracker

PF2e Downtime Tracker is a module for FoundryVTT's Pathfinder 2e system. It provides a simple interface that allows players to keep track of longer term downtime projects right from their character sheets.

# Features

## Flexibility to Suit Your Game
Not every campaign is the same! PF2e Downtime Tracker allows the GM to define the units that downtime is measured and displayed in throughought the module - weeks, days, noodles - the choice is yours! The GM can adjust this setting via **Game Settings > Configure Settings > PF2e Downtime Tracker > Downtime Unit**.

## Not Just For Crafting
Keeping track of long term crafting projects may have been the inspiration for the module, but it's certainly not the only thing you'll need or want to keep track of. When you create a new project, or any time afterwards, you can define what unit to measure progress for that project with. It's a text field, so it can really be whatever you want!
